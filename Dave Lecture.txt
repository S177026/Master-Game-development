Dave Lecture;

Character Design:
There are poingnat scenes that draw me in emotinally, In the end icared about the outcome and the character.

Extremly powerful emotion arise from humans (Character are pretend humans)
Humans and pretend humans provide access to vicarious emotion

	Emotion catorgory
	- Fun Emotion - without narrative
	- Narrative Emotion - Story/them of game
	- Vicarius Emotion
	- Artifact Emotion
	
Empahty and sympthy

E is feeling with another
S for another

	Emphaphy
	- we can emphithetically feel emotions that another human is feeling
	- the recieved emotion are facsimilies ( not feeling the same emotion as the character)
	- Identification + Concern = Empathy
	- Vicarius bond	
	- Vicarius emotion are an individual interpretation of anothers emotions
	- An interpretation takes into account belief/understanding and is contexual
	
Vicarius Emotion
- We may even experience and emotion on behalve of another person
- second hand emotion is an example of a vicarious emotion that continues to perplex and divide researchers
- Current emphathy theories focus on how we feel emotions for others who feel the same thing but not how we feel emotionfor others that they do not feel

- Too experience emotion empathetically, we must care about, and identify emotion
- Anthropomorphisation Sponge = SpongeBob

Attribution of human motivation, characteristics or behaviours

	- Paredolia - See faces in unusal items

We draw from real life to make our charcters believe and relatable

We need to make characters exergerate because our brain relises that it is not real
We do not copy real life
Characters are superiour to reality, they are exergerated

Fictional characters are not real, but if the=y are designed well our emotional connection

If you want your players to identify with, and care about, your charcters, you must identify with, and care about them first.

Individuality 
- A stranger is only a stranger until you know their name (Pig is a pork chop, when you give the pig a name it changes how you feel about the pork chop)
- Walks, talks, does thing that humans do, give bond to the player. Creates different emotion's between animals, Creates vicarious emotions for the NPC, but not they standard animals.
- Huamns and charcters has wants and needs, they relise they have a flaw, then change at the end of the story.
- Cute (Child-like quality's, remove disease and disgust cues)

Friday. Saw her goin somewhere with a dark girl called rose.


Dave Lecture: forward motion;
Job is to make people think or to elicit emotion, Emotion responses are more visceral

Forward Motion- All you need to do is keep the reader turning the page/playing game
Makes the audience want to know what happens next

We create the anticpation of emotional responses
if the player does not believe they are heading towards a disirable emotion they will stop playing
Rising action over time which hit a point to release

Curosity and concern
Mystery involes curiosity but not concern
Suspense involves curiosity and concern

Mystery is intellectual, suspense is emotional

Deus Ex Machina: Gods From Machine

Prophetic misdirection: State something then twist it.
