		Now that you know where you stand alongside your competitors marketing effort, it is up to you to decide what you would have to do to keep up with a similar pace or even surpass them.

		Is it publishing volume that is outpacing you or simply the great quality of content published and promoted?
		Addressing now weaknesses in your content strategy/promotion is key to gain at least a similar level of success. 
		Of course no one wants to be a copycat but when it comes to having a solid content plan in place there is no shame in looking at what others did to be successful with their game.

		Important thing here is to look at your social metrics of every channel and see what is working for you and what doesnâ€™t.
